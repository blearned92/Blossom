## General info
This project is a Hash Map relating names of flowers to their symbolic meanings using Separate Chaining to avoid collisions.

Prior to creating this project, I learned about different ways to handle collisions within a Hash Function. This was a practice to not only improve on creating a hash map, but also using linked lists within a hash map to store data in chains without having to rely on linear probing. I ran into an indentation error that caused problems in assigning new key:value pairs into the lists, and it took a moment to uncover, but overall it was a good experience to grow!
